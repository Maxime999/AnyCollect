This project aims to collect metrics by reading files or executing commands, and parsing their contents/outputs with regular expressions. It is designed to work with [Snap Telemetry](http://snap-telemetry.io).

This repo is organized as the following:
- AnyCollect C++ library
- AnyCollectValues which provides a standalone interface for the AnyCollect package
- AnyCollectSnap, the Snap plugin interface for the AnyCollect package

The Snap plugins require a special version of the [C++ Snap plugin library](https://github.com/Maxime999/snap-plugin-lib-cpp).

Refer to [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for more information on how to use these programs.

## Getting started
### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by plugin:
* Linux/amd64

### System Requirements
A C++ 17 compiler such as GCC 7 is required.

The libraries and standalone interfaces do not have additional dependencies. The Snap plugin interface requires the [C++ Snap plugin library](https://github.com/Maxime999/snap-plugin-lib-cpp) and its dependencies, which should be installed on the system first. AnyCollect uses static linking of those libraries for the programs to be portable.

Refer to the DEPENDENCIES.md file for more information.


### Compiling
If the Snap and its dependencies are built in the `/usr/local/lib`, execute `ldconfig /usr/local/lib/` to allow the `ld` linker to look for installed libraries there.

Then you can compile with CMake:

``` bash
cd AnyCollect
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
make install
```

Other build configured types are `Debug`, `Release`, and `RelWithDebInfo` (to profile with [Linux Perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) or [GPerfTools](https://gperftools.github.io/gperftools/)).

### Compiling dependencies
The `buildall.sh` script can be used to build AnyCollect Snap Plugin library and its dependencies automatically. It can either download the dependencies from GitHub or use local ones in the `third_party` folder.

### Configuration and Usage
Refer to [USAGE.md](USAGE.md). **Please be careful about the metric instantiation rules detailed in this usage file.**


## Documentation
The documentation can be built with Doxygen from the `build` directory. It is installed in `doc/html`.

``` bash
cd AnyCollect
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make doc
make install
```


## Community Support
