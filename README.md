# AnyCollect
This project aims to collect metrics by reading files or executing commands, and using regular expressions. It is designed to work with [Snap Telemetry](http://snap-telemetry.io).

It is composed of multiple packages:
- AnyCollect, which does most of the work: collecting, storing, processing, computing statistics, etc., as well as getting information about which metrics are collected
- AnyCollectValues which provides a standalone interface for the AnyCollect package
- AnyCollectSnap, the Snap plugin interface for the AnyCollect package

The Snap plugins require a special version of the [C++ Snap plugin library](https://github.com/Maxime999/snap-plugin-lib-cpp).


## Dependencies
All project packages except Snap plugins have no dependencies and can be built directly. A C++17 compatible compiler (such as GCC 7) is required.

Before compiling Snap plugins, the [C++ Snap plugin library](https://github.com/Maxime999/snap-plugin-lib-cpp) and its dependencies should be installed on the system. AnyCollect uses static liniking of those libraries for the executables to be portable.


## Compiling
If the Snap and its dependencies are built in the `/usr/local/lib`, execute `ldconfig /usr/local/lib/` to allow ld to look for installed libraries there.

Then you can compile with CMake:

``` bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
make install
```

Other build configured types are `Debug`, `Release`, and `RelWithDebInfo` (to profile with [Linux Perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) or [GPerfTools](https://gperftools.github.io/gperftools/)).

### `buildall` script
The `buildall.sh` script can be used to build AnyCollect Snap Plugin library and its dependencies automatically. It can either download the dependencies from GitHub or use local ones in the `third_party` folder.


## Documentation
The documentation can be built with Doxygen from the `build` directory. It is installed in `doc/html`.

``` bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make doc
make install
```
